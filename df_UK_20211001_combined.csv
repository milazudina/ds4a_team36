About the job
 
Summary
 
We are currently seeking applications for a Fisheries Biologist/Data Analyst within Marine Scotland based in Pitlochry. This is a permanent and pensionable appointment and new entrants will normally start on the minimum of the pay range. Candidates with a disability who meet the essential criteria below will be invited to the assessments.

 

 
This post is required to support the operation, collation, analysis and quality control of data on Atlantic salmon, brown trout and European eels collected at the Girnock and Baddoch index monitoring sites. These sites and associated fish traps are unique in Scotland, providing robust and detailed long-term data for understanding and assessing population dynamics, status and trends, which in turn inform and underpin development of assessment methods.

 

 
Due to the volume and heterogeneity of data collection methods at the monitoring sites, you will require advanced data analysis, database and coding (R) skills. You will be required to publish data in a variety of formats including public datasets, web sites, reports and importantly, peer reviewed publications. You will support maintenance of the traps and field data collection during busy periods, including trap operations and summer electrofishing. You will therefore be required to have (or develop) specialist skills in managing and operating fish traps, handling and processing fish in challenging outdoor environments.

 

 
You will be responsible for the direct line management of 4 staff and the day-to-day administration of trap facilities. Additionally, you will also be required to support other projects in the Freshwater Environment Group, including data collation, quality control and database entry of data collected under the National Electrofishing Programme for Scotland (NEPS).

 

 
Prospective applicants should note that this role involves outdoor work, often in challenging conditions and in remote locations. Elements of this role are physically demanding, e.g. cleaning and lifting of steel trap screens, and applicants will need to be able to repetitively lift a weight of 30 kilos to clear a minimum vertical distance of 1.0 metre. The ability to do so will be tested if you are successful in being invited to interview.
 
Job description
 
? Plan and manage the day-to-day running of the Girnock and Baddoch traps to collect

 
data on adult and juvenile Atlantic salmon, sea trout and European eel and report data

 
as required. Work with the Business Operations team and external contractors to ensure

 
routine maintenance of traps and other facilities.

 
? Analyse large fish and spatial datasets in ‘R’ including fitting complex spatial statistical

 
river network models and produce high quality scientific output in the form of peer reviewed publications, reports and presentations to a range of recipients.

 
? Direct line-management of four members of staff. Ensure staff are managed according

 
to the SG performance management system, are clear on immediate work priorities,

 
staffing schedules, cover during busy periods and that there are suitable opportunities

 
for training and development.

 
? Data entry and querying through the MSS FishObs database. Publication of public

 
datasets.

 
? Operate fixed-location adult and juvenile fish traps and collect information on size, sex

 
and age of fish. Lead electrofishing teams to monitor salmonid populations and obtain

 
estimates of abundance using both backpack and bank-based electrofishing equipment.
 

 
Responsibilities
 
1. Peer-reviewed publication record commensurate with stage of career

 
2. Experience of coding and statistical analysis in R involving modelling of complex ecological or environmental datasets.

 
3. Evidence of successful people management, team working and collaborative research

 
4. Experience delivering successful field data collection programmes.

 Important Information Regarding Interviews
 
In recognition of the Scottish Government's ongoing measures and guidance in its response to Covid-19 (Coronavirus), we would like to advise applicants that a decision has been taken that all interviews must be conducted in a virtual/remote setting. If you are short-listed at interview you will subsequently be invited to the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory to undertake the practical test (see details below).
 

 
In order to facilitate this new way of working, we are asking all applicants to ensure that they have a suitable space to complete the virtual interview as well as a personal device which has ability to video conference (e.g. Skype / MS Teams) and complete a data analysis practical in R should they be selected for interview.
 

 
We are also asking you to ensure that your personal Wi-Fi/Broadband capacity will be sufficient to carry both audio and video feeds to undertake the interview. This will then ensure that there are no issues incurred during the interview.
 

 
For those candidates that pass the interview, there will also be a practical lifting test. This will involve repeatedly lifting a steal fish trap screen, as is required at the traps. First, the lifting technique will be demonstrated by a current member of the Traps Team. You will then assess the weight yourself by lifting the weight a short distance from the ground. If you feel confident that you can safely lift the weight using the demonstrated technique, then you will begin the lifting test. You will be asked to repeatedly lift the screen to clear a minimum vertical distance of 1.0 metre. This will be completed under observation to ensure safe lifting technique. If at any point you fail to exhibit appropriate technique or struggle with the test, then you will be asked to immediately stop lifting. This practical will take place outside following social distancing guidelines. Screens will be disinfected before and after lifting is undertaken.
 

 
Due to Covid-19 (Coronavirus) restrictions, candidates will not have access to the buildings so must arrive in suitable clothing to complete the lifting test in any weather conditions. Public toilets are available in Pitlochry: https://www.pkc.gov.uk/article/19430/Pitlochry-public-toilets

 

 

 Applicants who are EU Nationals
 
Any applicant with, or applying for, EU Settled Status, must provide one of the following;
 

 If you have already been granted Settled Status, please e-mail evidence of this to recruitment@gov.scot when you submit your application.
 If you have applied for Settled Status and are awaiting a decision, please e-mail recruitment@gov.scot confirming this when you submit your application.
 Failure to provide this information or a suitable alternative evidencing your right to work in the UK will result in your application being automatically rejected.

The HPRU protects and improves the public’s health through better application of cost-effective public health interventions.
 

 

 
This post will be based in the HPRU’s Mycobacteria research theme, split into two areas of research; Tuberculosis (TB) and Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).
 

 
TB: 
 Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers new opportunities for understanding and interrupting TB transmission. Although WGS data is routinely available in England, to maximise its utility for shaping public health responses it needs to be integrated with epidemiological investigations. In the context of underserved populations, it is critical for technical initiatives to be supported by improved access-to-care to reduce diagnostic delay. Here we aim to utilise WGS, phylogenetic analysis, surveillance data and social network analysis (SNA) to inform the design and evaluation of interventions to reduce TB transmission.
 

 
NTM
 : NTM isolates account for 60% of PHE’s mycobacterial laboratory workload. The greatest NTM knowledge gaps are around burden and public health relevance. There is limited information about risk-factors for infection, colonisation and disease. The poor understanding of transmission dynamics (despite routine WGS of NTM isolates) hinders PHE’s ability to design and implement public health interventions. We will create an innovative research database linking the datasets of clinical isolates, including WGS data, with patient registries to characterise the epidemiology of NTM.
 

 Duties and responsibilities
 

 Duties include, using PHE derived data you will analyse historical TB transmission clusters and analyse genomic signatures of transmission, with the purpose of developing a genomic surveillance tool.
  
 You will also utilise PHE derived data to better understand patterns of patterns of NTM acquisition and transmission in the UK. You will manage research projects, publish research in high quality peer reviewed journals and present results at internal and external meetings, both nationally and internationally as required

About Healx
 

 
Healx is a mission-driven technology company pioneering the next wave of drug discovery in order to bring novel, effective treatments to rare disease patients around the world. There are 7,000 known rare diseases that affect 400 million people across the globe, but only 5% of those conditions have an approved treatment. By combining frontier AI technology with deep drug discovery and development expertise, Healx can accelerate the pace, increase the scale and improve the chance of success of rare disease treatment development in order to meet this huge unmet need and have unprecedented patient impact.
 

 
Founded in Cambridge, UK, in 2014 by Dr Tim Guilliams (a Biochemical Engineer and tech entrepreneur) and Dr David Brown (former Global Head of Drug Discovery at Roche), Healx has raised $70 million to date, added over a dozen projects to its risk-balanced therapeutic portfolio, and built a cross-functional team of over 90 tech and drug discovery experts.
 

 
At the core of our approach is Healnet, the next generation AI platform we built to attack the drug discovery problem in a massively parallel, hypothesis-free way. We deploy Healnet across three core areas: drug redevelopment, combination therapy development, and molecular enhancement. In each of these areas, Healnet uses cutting-edge AI to rapidly discover novel disease biology and modes of action - without being limited to a single target - and identify non-obvious connections between that biology and existing compounds. Our team then applies their deep drug discovery and development expertise to accelerate these novel treatment opportunities towards the clinic.
 

 
We are looking for innovative machine learning experts who are keen to pioneer the next generation of drug discovery by re-engineering the entire process from the ground up, applying the latest techniques across our entire pipeline, and opportunities exist within a number of specialisms.
 

 
You'll be:
 

 Working in collaboration with bioinformaticians, cheminformaticians, and computational systems biologists to develop novel 'drug X treats disease Y' prediction methods.
 Enhancing our knowledge graph with new predicted relationships, continually re-evaluating our understanding of the data and proactively informing pharmacologists as drugs and diseases become viable.
 Creating novel computational chemistry techniques to take drug 'hits' from the Healx platform and predict optimal modifications to drug properties.
 Applying cutting-edge machine vision methods to collect image-based features from high-content phenotypic screens, iteratively improving our predictive methods.
 Identifying areas to strengthen our knowledge of a specific drug or disease, and developing the systems required to automatically generate testable hypotheses.
 

 We're looking for someone who has:
 

 Passion; care deeply about Healx's aims for improving the lives of rare disease patients and how your work will help us.
 Enthusiasm for the use of Healx's new technologies.
 Integrity; live by our company values.
 Delivers reliably against agreed objectives.
 Able to rapidly see the 'big picture' of company objectives and priorities.
 Build great relationships; great communication and collaboration is the key to getting things done.
 Self-Improver; stay professionally relevant, network, enjoy learning and set high standards for yourself and others.
 Love feedback; understand that feedback is a vital part of making progress.
 Resilience; stay focussed and motivated, especially when things get tough
 Adaptable - within a fast-moving company.
 Self-Awareness; understand how others perceive you; know your strengths and know your weaknesses.
 

 Qualification and Experiences
 

 Doctoral or Master of Science degree in Computational Biology; Bioinformatics; Computer Science; Machine Learning; Mathematics; or a closely aligned field, with industrial experience.
 Expert in the application of algorithms for modelling biological systems, and deriving an understanding of large biological data sets, particularly when operating on noisy or incomplete data.
 Experience in translating complex biological problems into machine learning and statistical problems, and computational models. Proven track record of delivery from your own experimental work would be desirable.
 Ability to produce robust proof-of-concept code in appropriate languages is essential, for example Python; Java; or Matlab.
 Proficiency with deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, Torch/PyTorch, Caffe.
 Enthusiasm to learn and share new methods and techniques with the rest of the team. A similar passion for biology and physiology would be beneficial.
 Demonstrated experience working within multidisciplinary teams, and the ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional, geographically dispersed teams.

The position will run for 12 months and can be based at either of the institute's two campuses, in Harpenden, Hertfordshire or North Wyke, Devon.
 

 
With a clear and urgent need to transform our farming systems to make them more resource-efficient, less polluting and more resilient to external shocks, the value of agricultural experimental data is greater than ever. Established in 1843, Rothamsted Research is the world’s longest-running agricultural research institute with a wealth of information that can be utilised to determine what food we should grow where and how to achieve the oft-conflicting goals of food security, environmental/ecological sustainability and vibrant rural communities. Our Broadbalk arable rotation trial, for example, has continuously been running for 178 years, providing an invaluable evidence base for soil carbon dynamics, a major determinant of climate change impacts of agriculture.
 

 
Working as part of the Digital Rothamsted Initiative aiming to extract the untapped value of data resources and archived samples owned by the institute, the post holder will be responsible for standardisation of soil, agronomic, livestock, environmental/ecological and agribusiness data across multiple long-term trials being carried out at multiple sites in England (Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Suffolk and Devon) so that the performance of each treatment becomes comparable across trial boundaries. Using this unified database, the post holder will then lead a systematic appraisal of a diverse range of farming systems under Rothamsted’s portfolio, including the Long-term Experiments (LTEs), the Large Scale Rotation Experiment (LSRE) and the North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP), with the view to identify dominating (consistently superior) and dominated (consistently inferior) farming practices through a trade-off analysis. Finally, the post holder will collate life cycle inventory information associated with each production system and transfer them to HESTIA, a global open-access platform for agri-food life cycle assessment (LCA) data managed by the University of Oxford, to facilitate secondary use of project outputs. The Oxford Martin School will provide technical expertise for this component of work as an external project partner.
 

 

 Successful candidates will possess a PhD in agricultural science or a closely related field, advanced skills in data management and analysis, and a strong interest and professional-level knowledge in agricultural sustainability. Further requirements are outlined in the Person Specification and Shortlisting Criteria document.
 

 
Applicants must prepare a single PDF file combining (1) curriculum vitae, (2) cover letter detailing one by one how each essential (and desirable) criterion is satisfied and, optionally, (3) supporting documents as detailed in the Person Specification and Shortlisting Criteria document. This PDF file must be uploaded to the online application system as 'CV to attach to application', whereas the 'Candidate Profile' section of the online form should provide the brief summary of its content. 
 Applications not adhering to this instruction will be automatically rejected.
 

 

 The closing date for this vacancy is 10 October 2021. Shortlisted candidates will be invited to interviews, which are expected to be held on 18 October 2021. This post is for 12 months fixed term and attracts a salary ranging between £31,350 and £32,315 per annum.

 Our purpose is to help medical research progress 10x faster, and we’re looking for a Senior Bioinformatician to take our growth to the next level.
 
You’ll love the mission-driven environment of a growing start up and have the drive to take significant ownership in developing genomic data analysis pipelines and reports for precision medicine clinical research studies. You’ll have strong experience in in genetic data analysis in a clinical or research setting.
 
About Sano Genetics
 
Sano matches those with medical conditions with opportunities to contribute to research, via our unique online platform. We also provide personalised medical insights, information and recommendations. The platform is private-by-design. We feel strongly that people should be in full control of their sensitive health data and choose who can access it.
 
Taking part in research is currently hard to do and a poor experience for the patient. Finding out about opportunities is haphazard, and there is often little meaningful return for those who take the time and care to get involved. The result is that organisations with cutting edge theories and medicines to test, can’t find the right patients to work with. To discover cures for the diseases that affect us and our families, we need to enable people to contribute to medical science, effortlessly and on their own terms. We founded Sano to enable medical research that is data-driven and puts patients at the centre of the experience.
 
Our current focus is on neurological and immune conditions (Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Long COVID amongst others).
 
A vital part of our offer is free at-home DNA testing. Each patient can then share their genetic data with the studies they wish to contribute to just through a few clicks. In this way, researchers can reach many people who wouldn’t be able to travel, globally, and run their studies much faster and at lower cost.
 
Today, the Sano platform is helping thousands of people connect to relevant research projects including clinical trials which are testing new medicines.
 
Over the next year, we are expanding our product to be a 'patient portal' for national scale precision medicine initiatives such as Genomics England, with the goal of impacting millions of people.
 
We are a team of 22 people today, so this is an exceptional chance to join early in our journey to help define our culture, and the company’s mission.

 About our Team

 The School of Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS) at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK, is recruiting a post-doctoral research associate (RA) to work on the EPSRC funded project EP/V051164/1/1 â€œDeveloping Machine Learning-empowered Responsive Manufacture of Industrial Laser Systemsâ€�.

 The robotics research group at the Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems (ISSS) aims to develop robotic technologies for industrial applications. Our research related to this position focuses on (1) understanding human behaviour and human factors in industrial tasks, (2) design, control, and implementation of robotic systems to automate industrial tasks by transfer of knowledge of human expert behaviour and human factors, and (3) development of machine learning techniques to capture human expert knowledge/skills and to develop robot manipulator behaviours in industrial task execution. One of the streams of our research is fine manipulation tasks requiring professional skills, typical to optical laser systems manufacturing and laser systems alignment.

 Detailed Description

 We are looking for a highly experienced and skilled PDRA who will work on the EPSRC (Part of the UK national research council) project EP/V051164/1/1 â€œDeveloping Machine Learning-empowered Responsive Manufacture of Industrial Laser Systemsâ€œ. The project aims to develop new automated robotic processes for the assembly and manufacture of industrial laser systems taking advantage of the latest research in robotics and machine learning. The PDRA will be responsible for developing machine learning techniques to capture expert human behaviour and develop machine intelligence to search and optimize robotic behaviour to achieve excellent laser alignment and assembly of optical pieces. A fundamental challenge in building optical laser systems is alignment of pieces, which typically requires high skills and much time. An automated robotic and mechatronic system can embed machine intelligence derived from analysis of human expert performances. The PDRA will be responsible for developing the machine intelligence that embeds captured human skills and intelligent search and optimization algorithms. The PDRA will closely collaborate with three other PDRA, one working on robotic manipulation and mechatronic systems, one working on development of laser assembly setups and data generation, and another working on expert human behaviour analysis. All the team will also work in close collaboration with laser manufacturing industry. Flexible, self-taught, autonomous manufacturing processes will find applications across the photonic and laser manufacturing sector. This is an exciting large scale, interdisciplinary project which will be one of the first housed within the new multi-million pounds National Robotarium facility at HWU. National Robotarium (https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/research/the-national-robotarium.htm) will be an exceptional facility bringing together academic research and industry in Heriot-Watt University campus and is expected to house extremely impactful industry-oriented research.

 The project is in collaboration with four industrial partners: (i) Gooch & Housego Plc. provide expertise in the manufacture of optics and optical assemblies typically used in the construction of laser systems. (ii) Leonardo MW, and (iii) Luxinar Limited are laser system manufacrures with an interest in automating new and existing laser production processes. Finally (iv) Renishaw are experts in a variety of high precision laser based metrology and manufacturing equipment with a wide range of relevant manufacturing processes.

 This is a highly interdisciplinary project including teams and researchers on laser systems, robotics, machine learning, and human-machine systems. Therefore, the PDRA in this particular position focusing on machine learning and intelligence is expected to also have interest in closely collaborating with the researchers working on these other domains within the team. Therefore, interest in and perhaps background knowledge on robotic and mechatronic systems, human behaviour analysis, and laser systems will be considered as a plus.

 Candidates will have a strong interest and background in machine learning with a PhD degree, or equivalent experience in electrical engineering, computer science, applied mathematics or a related area. Strong competences in robotics, control, software engineering, robotic software development including embedded systems and scientific programming are desirable.

 Exact salary within scale 7 can be negotiated on experience and excellence criteria. Outstanding candidates may also be granted responsibility of co-supervising a PhD student on a subject related to their research.

 The position should start on 1st of December 2021 or as early as possible after that, and applications will be fully considered until the position is filled.

 Applicants should provide the following documents and apply through the online application website. Applications with incomplete documentation will not be considered.

 -Letter of motivation highlighting relevance of background to the project,

 -CV

 -Two major publications in relation to the project,

Our focus is in the areas of quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, and quantum encryption.
 *
 Quantum Algorithms and Machine Learning at Cambridge Quantum*
 The quantum computers available today have proven to be a viable tool to investigate scientific, engineering, and industrial problems. Yet, the full potential of quantum computation has not been unlocked. In fact, hardware limitations typical of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale (NISQ) era, such as noise, a small number of qubits, and inefficient Input/Output operations have hindered the implementation of well known, powerful algorithms. On one hand, Variational Quantum Algorithms_ (VQAs)_ can circumvent NISQ obstacles but closer scientific scrutiny is necessary to understand the trade off between robustness and efficiency. On the other hand, quantum algorithms that have quantum advantage guarantees and are suitable for NISQ devices are mostly unexplored territory.
 At CQ we have studied machine learning (ML) problems and used parameterized quantum circuits as quantum models for supervised learning, generative modelling, and Bayesian inference. CQ scientists have explored the reach of VQAs beyond ML, to attack nonlinear partial differential equations, combinatorial optimization, quantum simulation and Monte Carlo sampling. Whilst VQAs have proven to be practical and flexible tools for current NISQ computers, we believe that developing algorithms that go beyond variational approaches is crucial. We are committed to researching ways of bringing the advantage guarantees of algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computers to NISQ hardware more systematically, which is a key goal for the whole quantum computing sector in the medium term.

 The research will be both theoretical and aimed at benchmarking new algorithms on the state of the art of quantum computers. Significant results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and/or patented. Aside from the pure research focus, this role will support client engagements by contributing to the definition of the scientific scope, the problem formulation, and the solution using quantum algorithms.

We hire the brightest minds in the world to tackle some of the biggest questions in finance. We pair this expertise with machine learning, big data, and some of the most advanced technology available to predict movements in financial markets.

 The role

 The Opportunities Evaluation Group (OEG) is an exciting new team at G-Research that sits alongside our core Research function. Its remit is simple: to do the impossible.

 While Research is a world-class, large-scale operation with established approaches and technologies, not all problems fit nicely into one framework.

 OEG’s approach, therefore, is different. Starting with the core principle is that any problem is fair game, it is our job to prioritise ideas outside the business’s current capabilities and then demonstrate the value by building proof-of-concept systems which can later be integrated.

 OEG need to move fast and discount bad ideas quickly. We do this using a small team of highly talented individuals working closely together and using the best new technology to give us a head-start. Being small means we can be nimble, changing our approaches and our tools to suit the problem in front of us but never compromising on the rigour of our scientific method.

 Who are we looking for?

 OEG looks for the very best Quants and Engineers to assist with its mission. Our preferred candidates are those with a strong mathematical background who can perform across a broad set of problems (“T-shaped” people). We like Quants who have a greater-than-average exposure to technology and coding, because we need to build the Research systems as well as use them. Above all, we want innovators and critical thinkers.

 The ideal candidate will at minimum have strong interest or experience in the following areas:

 Applying mathematical concepts to real-world (financial) problems

 Implementing theoretical insights as working code

 A Masters or PhD degree in a highly quantitative subject (Mathematics, Statistics, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Physics) – either complete or currently working towards
